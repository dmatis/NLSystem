# NLSystem

A natural language based expert system for answering questions based on a database of expert knowledge

## Start Here

## To Play

1. Enter 'solve.' in the shell console after rules have loaded
2. The system will attempt to guess a bird that you have in mind by a series of questions
3. Respond to each with a 'yes.' or 'no.'
